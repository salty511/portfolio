		<li><b>Goal:</b> Investigate an alternative method for modeling the Earth's magnetic field using scalar data, constrained by a physical feature of the dayside field.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Tools/Tech:</b> Python, Matplotlib, Linux/Unix Shell Scripting, Fortran</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<p>
		My Master's project explored a novel approach to geomagnetic field modeling that circumvents the traditional requirement for full vector magnetic data. 
		Typically, accurate models depend on vector measurements due to the <i>Backus effect</i>, where multiple field configurations can explain the same scalar intensity.
	</p>
	<br>

	<p>
		To address this non-uniqueness, the project leveraged the <b>Equatorial Electrojet (EEJ)</b>‚Äîa current system on the Earth's dayside that acts as a proxy for 
		the magnetic equator, where the radial magnetic field component is effectively zero. By using this physical constraint in combination with scalar field 
		intensity data, we established a pseudo-vector condition along the equator, enabling a more stable and interpretable model.
