	<ul> 
		<li><b>Goal:</b> Model buyer behavior for airline customer bookings to improve prediction accuracy despite imbalanced target classes.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Tools/Tech:</b> Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Random Forest, Sampling techniques (oversampling, undersampling)</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>
		This project was part of the British Airways data science certification in which I worked to model buyer behavior for customer bookings using random forest methods. 
		The main thing I learned from this project was how the balance of target variable classes can affect the performance of a model, 
		and how to use techniques such as oversampling and undersampling to mitigate this.
